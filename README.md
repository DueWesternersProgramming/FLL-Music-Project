An example of installing this library is `sudo apt install libasound2-dev -y`

Run the *Main.py* file to start the application. The controller tab will house
all if your controllers to start the timer and fade the volume. Full screen
for the controller is not required due to scaling, but scale up the display/timer screen
to the size of your screen.

If you want to build a fully-packaged executable file, run the *Build.py* file.
